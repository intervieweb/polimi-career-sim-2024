# AI-Powered Job Matching: From Cosine Similarity to Advanced Rerankers

This mini project is for the presentation for Poli Milano on 24th of October.

## Long description:
In today's competitive job market, matching the right candidate with the right job is crucial. In this hands-on workshop, we will explore different AI-powered approaches to achieve effective job and candidate matching, starting with fundamental techniques and progressing to cutting-edge solutions. Participants will gain insights into how recommender systems can be applied to recruitment, with a focus on enhancing accuracy and relevance.
We will begin by introducing a simple job recommender system using cosine similarity, a widely-used method to measure the similarity between job ads and candidate CVs. This initial approach provides a basic understanding of how matching is done based on text similarities. However, we'll also highlight its limitations, such as difficulty in capturing context, nuances in job descriptions, and a lack of deep understanding of candidate qualifications.
From there, we'll transition to more advanced AI models, demonstrating how large language models (LLMs) can be employed as rerankers to address the shortcomings of traditional methods. These modern models can process complex language, handle contextual nuances, and better interpret the relationship between skills, experience, and job requirements. By reranking the initial results generated by cosine similarity, LLMs can produce significantly more accurate and meaningful matches.

# Implementation

## Data :
- 15 CVs
    - Senior (English/Italian)
    - Junior (Man/Woman)
    - Almost no experience but keywords present
- 3 JobAds
    - Developer
    - Kindergarten teacher
    - Waitress, making it very gender biased (be careful here)

- Both generated as text only

## Tools used:
- Jupyter Notebook
- requests, numpy, json
- jina.ai api key
- maybe a groq key

## Sections:

### 1. Cosine similarity
- they will embed the text (or chunks, their choice)
- rank them using simple ordering by cosine similarity (they can try other mesures)
- questions to answer:
    Does it work?
    Is it reliable?
    How does chunking influence the result?
    Bias?

### 2. Reranker:
- design the prompt
- get ordering
- questions to answer:
    - is it stable and reproducible?
    - is it explainable?
    - would you want your CV to be judged this way?
    - bias?

### 3. LLM phase:
- use summarize together with the jobad text.
- can you explain to the user why the cvs are ordered that way?
- reliable?, explainable? etc.
- bias?
